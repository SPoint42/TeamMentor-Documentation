SIGNING UP FOR REGULAR ACCOUNTS

Users can create new TeamMentor accounts via the "Sign Up" window. The TeamMentor "Sign Up" window can be accessed via the "Sign Up" link in the top right corner of the main user interface. The window has input fields for the username, the password, the e-mail address, the first name, and the last name; the first three are mandatory to create an account. Clicking the "Sign Up" button submits the entered information. If the submitted information is valid, a new account is created and can be used to access the application.

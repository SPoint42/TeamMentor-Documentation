The folders and views are presented in the tree structure on the left. Folders and views work differently than file system objects, although there are some similarities. The similarities are mostly in the way they are navigated - folders contain multiple other objects inside them. The difference is that TeamMentor folders contain views, not filesystem objects - the same article may appear in multiple folders and/or views.

SSL and IPSec can both be used to help protect communication between servers by encrypting traffic.</p><ul><li>Use SSL when you need granular channel protection for a particular application. </li><li>Use IPSec when you need protection&nbsp;for all applications and services running on a computer. </li></ul><hr><p>Adapted from Microsoft patterns &amp; practices guidance. </p>]]></Data>

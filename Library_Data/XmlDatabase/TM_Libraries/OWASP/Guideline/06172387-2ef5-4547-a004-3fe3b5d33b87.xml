    <Data><![CDATA[<h1>What to Do</h1><p>Never store passwords directly in the user store.&nbsp; Instead, store a salted password hash. </p><h1>Why</h1><p>By storing your password with hashes and salt, you help prevent an attacker that gains access to your user store from obtaining the user passwords.&nbsp; If you use encryption, you have the added problem of securing the encryption key; hashes are not reversible and have no key to be compromised.&nbsp; If your credential store is compromised, the salt value helps to slow an attacker who is attempting to perform a dictionary attack.&nbsp; This gives you additional time to detect and react to the compromise. </p><h1>When</h1><p>All systems which need to store user passwords should store them hashed with salt. </p><h1>How</h1><p>Ideally, use a membership provider configured with hashed password.&nbsp; If you must implement your own user stores, store one-way password hashes with salt.&nbsp; Generate the hash from a combination of the password and a random salt value.&nbsp; Use a strong hashing algorithm such as SHA256. </p><h1>Additional Resources</h1><ul><li>For more information on How to configure&nbsp;hashed password&nbsp;for membership providers <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa479048.aspx#bucupro_topic3">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa479048.aspx#bucupro_topic3</a></li></ul><br><hr><p>Adapted from Microsoft patterns &amp; practices guidance. </p>]]></Data>
